### PART 8
HASH MAP
A data structure that stores a list of key-value pairs. (Compare: dictionaries in Python.)
* It exists in Java as HashMap<>(): import with java.util.HashMap
* You can set the data type of keys and values seperately:
HashMap<String, Integer> hash = new HashMap<>();
* Only one key/value pair at a time: a reassignment wipes the old value

ADD: hash.put("five", 3);
GET: hash.get("five"); retrieves the VALUE of "five" which is 3

WHEN TO USE:
* it's best to use hash maps when you know exactly what you're looking for: if you have to search based on a partial key, then it'll probably take longer and up that Big O rating
* lists are still good to sort and keep order of items
